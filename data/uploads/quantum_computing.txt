Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational capabilities.
Unlike classical computers that use bits, quantum computers use qubits.
Qubits can exist in superposition, allowing quantum computers to process multiple states simultaneously.
Major tech companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft are investing heavily in quantum research.
Quantum supremacy was demonstrated by Google in 2019.
